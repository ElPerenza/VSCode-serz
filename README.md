# RailWorks Serz integration for Visual Studio Code

> For information on installation, usage and contributing, [check out the wiki](https://github.com/ElPerenza/VSCode-serz/wiki).

This is an extension that integrates the serz.exe utility from the game Train Simulator Classic (also known as RailWorks) into Visual Studio Code, to convert the game .bin files to .xml and vice versa directly from within the editor.  
This extension is intended as a replacement for the .bin editing capabilities of the now-defunct TS-Tools program, while also being much faster and more user freindly thanks to Visual Studio Code's superior code editing and Search and Replace features.
